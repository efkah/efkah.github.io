Finally holidays are here! On our way to Venice we had a stop at Milano Grand Central, a Station with a very unique boarding system. Just like on the airport there was an inner and outer region und you couldnâ€™t just go from one side to the other.

Going by train now had this unique metropolitan feeling you know from the movies at airports.
