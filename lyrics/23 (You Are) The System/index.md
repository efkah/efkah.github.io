# (You Are) The System

_(You Are) The System_ is a fictional electro band, writing songs for an upcoming revolution. Their members are:

- The Voice (of the System)
- Rootolf -1
- Johnny M. Chanyk

As for an electro band, their lyrics usually are short and pointed, but since the voice is a closet-poet, too, the list might also contain some lyrics that did not fit the band.
