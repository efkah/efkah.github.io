Metal Town

**********

 
g
    why should we try to carry on
a
    when every world we knew collapsed
F
    when every solarsystem's gone
C
    when every home we reach is dead

 

when every future's out of scope
when there is no reason for hope
when everywhere we try to settle down
we are cast-outs from alien metal town 

why should we try to carry on
when hatred's all we ever reap
when every life leaves us alone
when all we wanna do is sleep 

'cause every future's out of scope
'cause there is no reason for hope
'cause every time we come around
we get tossed back in our metal town 

g
... alone, astray in a vacuum maze
D7
... floating endlessly through space
C
searching for what never will be found
F                        a
in our electronic rocket metal town
Horizon
=======

[ Refrain ]
Is there a meaning for existence
 For the struggles in our life?
Oh, is there hope behind horizon?
 Or is horizon just a lie?

Time and Space and Higgs Boson
And black Holes - endless Dimension
Dimensions, none of us make out
Horizon, what's it all about?

Horizon is the end of light
Eternity's just out of sight
The longer lives the universe
The more horizon to observe

The universe - Expanding disc
Reality's the edge of this
Existence on the borderline
is a matter of space and time

[ Repeat ]
So, Is there a meaning for existence
 For the struggles in our life?
So, is there hope behind horizon?
 Or is horizon just a lie?
Appletree
=========

It took a genius to see
The Universe' an apple tree
Enlightenment came finally
Now everything seems so easy

We were stuck between the devil
 and the stormy deep blue sea
We were caught between a rock
 and a hard, hard place to be
We are locked between the bark
 and creations apple tree
Where even beatles are emerging 
 from so why, oh why, don't we?

It took a genius to see
The Universe' an apple tree
The Universe' an apple tree
The Universe' an apple tree

When the spark of wisdom hit us
 it was simple to foresee
That for our great escape there's
 endless possibilities
Black Hole, Red Dwarf and Hypergiant
 Apple Blossom, Honey Bee
Leaf, Limb, Root and Asteroid
 The Question's where we want to be?
 
The Answer is easy as pie
You worry not, you fly by high
Space emerges, Time goes by
caterpillar, butterfly

It took a genius to see
The Universe' an apple tree
Enlightenment came finally
Now everything seems so easy
