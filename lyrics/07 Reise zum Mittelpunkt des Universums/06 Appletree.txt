Appletree
=========

[ Refrain x2 ]
   A#
It took a genius to see
    F
The Universe' an apple tree
  C
Enlightenment came finally
    F
Now everything seems so easy

         D
We were stuck between the devil
         G
 and the stormy deep blue sea
        D
We were caught between a rock
       G
 and a hard, hard place to be
       D
We are locked between the bark
        G
 and creations apple tree
           A
Where even beatles are emerging 
         C                  C7
 from so why, oh why, don't we?

It took a genius to see
The Universe' an apple tree
The Universe' an apple tree
The Universe' an apple tree

When the spark of wisdom hit us
 it was simple to foresee
That for our great escape there's
 endless possibilities
Black Hole, Red Dwarf and Hypergiant
 Apple Blossom, Honey Bee
Leaf, Limb, Root and Asteroid
 The Question's where we want to be?
 
The Answer is easy as pie
You worry not, you fly by high
Space emerges, Time goes by
caterpillar, butterfly

It took a genius to see
The Universe' an apple tree
Enlightenment came finally
Now everything seems so easy
