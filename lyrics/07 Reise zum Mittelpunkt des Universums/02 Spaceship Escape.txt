I am so tired.
I need to Sleep.
No more Power.
I get the Creeps.
        D#          F7
I am so tired. Need to Sleep.

d
any mistake
might be the end
lets just stay calm
my only friend
       D#        F7
any mistake. The End.

[ Refrain ]
G(hoch)     B
eternity is flying by
G(hoch)       B
no comfort to derive
G(hoch)           B
uncertainty preys on my mind
    F            G7       E7    F
how long will we survive?

time and space
tears us apart
but we stay strong
wir bleiben hart
time and space. never apart.

fly together
over the sea
and we will find
eternity
we fly towards. eternity.

[ Refrain ]
[ Same Chords as Refrain ]
endless possibilities
are waiting on our way
no matter what the future sees
we're living for the day... everyday!

A

[ Refrain langsam ]
...
We know we will survive
