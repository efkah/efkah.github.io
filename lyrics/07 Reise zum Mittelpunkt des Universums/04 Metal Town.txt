Metal Town

**********

 
g
    why should we try to carry on
a
    when every world we knew collapsed
F
    when every solarsystem's gone
C
    when every home we reach is dead

 

when every future's out of scope
when there is no reason for hope
when everywhere we try to settle down
we are cast-outs from alien metal town 

why should we try to carry on
when hatred's all we ever reap
when every life leaves us alone
when all we wanna do is sleep 

'cause every future's out of scope
'cause there is no reason for hope
'cause every time we come around
we get tossed back in our metal town 

g
... alone, astray in a vacuum maze
D7
... floating endlessly through space
C
searching for what never will be found
F                        a
in our electronic rocket metal town
