Horizon
=======

[ Refrain ]
Is there a meaning for existence
 For the struggles in our life?
Oh, is there hope behind horizon?
 Or is horizon just a lie?

Time and Space and Higgs Boson
And black Holes - endless Dimension
Dimensions, none of us make out
Horizon, what's it all about?

Horizon is the end of light
Eternity's just out of sight
The longer lives the universe
The more horizon to observe

The universe - Expanding disc
Reality's the edge of this
Existence on the borderline
is a matter of space and time

[ Repeat ]
So, Is there a meaning for existence
 For the struggles in our life?
So, is there hope behind horizon?
 Or is horizon just a lie?
