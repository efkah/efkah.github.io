[1:]
Cmaj7
The lights are dimmed
Am                 Dsus2
people are dancing close
Cmaj7
You looked at him

Am                 Dsus2      G
the most beautiful man on the dancefloor

so you took his hand
looked deep into his eyes
you wanna my man?
and you experienced true love at first sight

[CHORUS]
          C                      G
when love hits you take it as it comes
    C                          D            Dsus2 [oder so, ohne Mittelfinger]
you have to react fast - there is no second chance

    Bm              C        G
the modern world is cold and ruthless
     Bm                  C      D
your whole life may seem like a mess
    C        G        C        D -         E
but love can save you            - nevertheless

[2:]
The lonesome nights
spent in front of pc
all the spiralling bites
every single one depresses you

so you brought yourself
to sign up for online dating
to leave your shell
and to find the woman to spend the rest of your life with

[CHORUS]
[Maybe repeat the Bm - C - G / Bm - C - D / C G C D E]

[3:]
And so she said
you have to meet my friend
the two of you
Would perfectly fit to each other

And so you did
never regretted it
love can be so easy
when you dare to open up a little bit
