depression, actually
********************

[ Dm G C E7 - Dm G C E7 - Am D7 G ]
             Dm             G                C               E7
You have the urgent need to puke your inside out, but you're empty, 
Dm                    G                     C                  E7
Your lungs ache while breathing, your chest weights a thousand tons, 
     Am           D7                  G
your throat feels strangled words are choking you

Bm             E7
Everything' so pointless
Am            E
Everything is so pointless
Dm              C        G           Dm              C   G              D      A           D A
Lonelyness.is a zest for action, you wanna go in for something, but not all on your own.

Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Am           E
Where is the joy?

[ Dm G C E7 - Dm G C E7 - Am D7 G ]
     Dm                 G                 C                      E7
Your eyes burn, but you cannot cry, every muscle in your body is numb, 
     Dm             G                 C                 E7
your lips are numb, arms and legs are numb, fingers are numb, 
    Am        D7                 G
you still can move but cant feel movement

Bm             E7
Everything' so pointless
Am            E
Everything is so pointless
Dm               C       G            Dm          C   G         D            A      D A
And there always is this hunger, it's eternal and everlasting - emptyness in you.

Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Bm               E7
Everything is so pointless
Am           E
Where is the joy?

Alles ist so sinnlos.
Alles ist so sinnlos.
Alles ist so sinnlos.
Es gibt keine Freude mehr.
