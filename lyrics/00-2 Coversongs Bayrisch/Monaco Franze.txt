[Verso 2]

Em
The essence, the basics, without that you make it
Em
Allow me to make this, child-like-in-nature
Em
Rhythm, you have it or you don't that's a fallacy
    Em
I'm in them every sprouting tree, every child apiece
      Em
Every cloud you see. you see with your eyes,
      Em
I see destruction and demise, corruption in the skies
          Em
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lives
        Em
Through Russel not his muscles but percussion he provides
     Em
With me as their guide 
                                   Em
Y'all can see me now cuz you don't see with your eye 

You perceive with your mind
           Em
That's the inner
                                        Em
So I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
                                    Em
Bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers remember

I zoig eich wos kann ma dann überhaupt nu mocha, 
   Em
und wia ma überlebt wenn nua nu d bonzn lochan
Em
Gefühle und Ideen de du lang nimma ghobt host,
   Em                  (stop music)
kemman zruck und vazein da wos du zum doa host!


[Coro]

    Em                             Em
I'm happy, I'm feelin' glad, I got sunshine in a bag
    Em                             Em
I'm useless, but not for long the, future is comin' on (x2)


 [Coda]

    Em
It's comin' on, It's comin' on,

My future is comin' on, it's comin' on, it's comin' on,
