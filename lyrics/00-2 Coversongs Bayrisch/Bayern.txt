C  Fmaj7  Dm   Am   G  x4


[Verse]
C               Fmaj7
 Down in Albion, they're black and blue
C                        G
 But we don't talk about that
C                       Fmaj7
 Are you from round here? How do you do?
C                      G
 I'd like to talk about that...
          C                  Fmaj7
 Talk over, gin in teacups and leaves on the lawn
C                      G
 Violence at bus stops, and a pale thin girl with eyes forlorn
C                       Fmaj7
 More gin in teacups, and leaves on the lawn
C                             G
 Violence in dole queues and a pale thin girl,

behind the checkout...


[Chorus]
               Fmaj7                          C            G
 But if you're looking for a cheap sort set in false anticipation
       Fmaj7                              C           G
 I'll be waiting in the photo booth at the underground station
Fmaj7        C                                  G
 So come away, won't you come away, we could go to...
G
Deptford, Catford or Watford, Digberth, Mansfield
                  C
Anywhere in Albion...

  Fmaj7         Dm    Am   G          C       
  Anywhere in Albion... Anywhere in Albion...


[Verse]
C
Yellowing classics and
Fmaj7
Canons at dawn
C                              G
Coffee wallahs and pith helmets

And, an English song
  C
mmmm reebok classics and
Fmaj7
Canons at dawn

And an English song


[Chorus]
               Fmaj7                            C            G
 But if you're looking for a cheap sort all glint with perspiration
       Fmaj7                              C           G
There's a four mile queue outside the disused powerstation
Fmaj7        C                               G
 So come away, o say you'll come away and go to...
G
Satsworth, Senford, Weovil, Woomoyle, NEW-CAST-LE


               Fmaj7                              C            G
 But if you're looking for a cheap tart don't glint with perspiration
       Fmaj7                              C           G
There's a five mile queue outside the disused powerstation
Fmaj7          C                              G
Now come away, won't you come away we'll go to...
G

  Fmaj7         Dm    Am   G          C       Fmaj7         Dm    Am   G          C
