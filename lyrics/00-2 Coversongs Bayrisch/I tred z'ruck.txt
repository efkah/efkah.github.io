"Retirement"

C              a                            d
There are many things that I would be proud of
            G                         C
If I'd only invented them such as the wheel
                a                  d
The washing machine and the tumble dryer
           G                         E
On these inventions surely I could retire

C           G
I want to retire
            C
No longer required
              d                        A#
I want to get by without the man on my back
             C
A tear in my eye
                     a
With a heart full of pride
                   d
I must go out on a high
                E
And tell nobody why

There are many things that I know I could do
If I'd only have wanted to, such as create
The perfect soulmate everyone would admire
On this creation surely I could retire


C           G
I want to retire
            C
No longer required
              d                        A#
I want to get by without the man on my back
             C
A tear in my eye
                     a
With a heart full of pride
                   d
I must go out on a high
                E
And tell nobody why

I want to retire
Inform the suppliers
I'll leave the party in style
And not to be carried out
Without a cloud in the sky
I Got my fingers in pies
A Golden watch on my side
Will measure my free time

C a d
Now my place in History is surely assured
G C
I will be remembered here forever more
a d
Brand new product in place and a potential buyer
G E
Up on this next transaction surely I could retire


C           G
I want to retire
            C
No longer required
              d                        A#
I want to get by without the man on my back
             C
A tear in my eye
                     a
With a heart full of pride
                   d
I must go out on a high
                E
And tell nobody why

I want to retire
Inform the suppliers
I'll leave the party in style
And not to be carried out
Without a cloud in the sky
I Got my fingers in pies
A Golden watch on my side
Will measure my free time
