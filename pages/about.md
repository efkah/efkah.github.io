# About

This was a [starter template](https://vsoch.github.com/docsy-jekyll/) for a Docsy jekyll theme, based
on the Beautiful [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) that renders with Hugo. This version is intended for
native deployment on GitHub pages. See the [respository]({{ site.repo }}) for more details.

## Personalization

The Site has been adopted in minor ways to fit my needs. Some of these adoptions you might call "hacks", as i wasn't willing to learn all the ruby and jekyll tricks. Feel free to [open an issue](https://www.github.com/{{ site.github_repo }}/{{ site.github_user }}) if you can help!
