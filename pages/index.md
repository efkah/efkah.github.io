## Purpose

Homepages... they never quite suite. Either they just show off a beautiful product, or they just show news, but they never quite accomplish to be just a sweet, clean data storage. But wait, i thought to myself, there is but one famous site which accomplishes what i was looking for. And that's why i redesigned my former shiny homepage to a not very shiny wiki-like theme. Maybe the shinyness will be readded some day, but for now i can do what i always longed for in homepages: Focus on content creation. Let's see how this turns out

## Site Contents

On the left side you will find all the (linked) site contents in a neat hierarchical tree. If you are on mobile, use the circle-like sandwich menu next to the search box to open the overview. You will find four sections:

### 1. /stories

[Go there](stories)

I love to write stories - unfortunately i quite never find the time to do so. Mostly because my brain is almost never in the flow. I need a few days off, to clear my mind, be relaxed and have a lot of time to think about the story, otherwise i would have to force it too much. Anyhow, read some of my work here! It's almost exclusivly in german.

### 2. /lyrics

[Go there](lyrics)

For the last few years i regularly wrote poems and lyrics to play them with my guitar. Although i never looked for making money with this compositions, i am ready to share them now. Hey, i think some of them are quite good, even, hit potential! Go and find those gems (though most is in german)!

### 3. /docs aka. Knowledge Base

[Go there](docs)

Here is where i want to keep my computal knowledge. My old page featured a knowledge base, which was almost never used. I still have to move the files from there. But i gained a little more Knowledge over time and who knows, maybe i find some time to share it.

### 4. /news

[Go there](news)

The news Section is what people usually call a blog. But i'm gonna try to keep the content out there and just link to the content in the wiki structure. You can still subscribe the feed, if you're that much interested in me.
